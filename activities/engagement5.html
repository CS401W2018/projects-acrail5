        <p>Link to an outside website with an absolute link.
            href = hyper link reference
            Explain the difference between an absolute link and a relative link. Why would you use relative links?
            Aboslute link is other domain like to your own cite. It always starts with "https//..../..."
            Relative link is within your own website/domain and its not technically required but we should use this.
            You would use relative link to
            Link to another engagement assignment (something in the activity folder).
            Abosolute: Engagement 3: <a href="https://cs401w2018.github.io/projects-acrail5/activities/Engagement3.html"> Ammon Engage 3</a>
            Relative link: <a href="Engagement1.html">Engagement 1</a>
            List the 3 rules with relative links.
            1. Same Folder: Use the file name
            2. Different Folders: activities to linkshtml to others to page.html
            3. 
            Do links always need to be inside a NAV tag?</p>
