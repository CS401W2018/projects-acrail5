            Anime is my interest because I enjoy watching the creation of the artist everyday and the story line of the shows are amazing life lessons we can learn from.
        </p>

        <p><strong>Hajime No Ippo</strong></p>
        <p>
            I like this Anime because its about a young boy who gets bullied and decides to join into the boxing life style. The main character name is Ippo and he is an inspiration to many boxing fans. 
        </p>

        <p><strong>Solo Leveling</strong></p>
        <p>
            This anime is about a boy who goes into dungeons to earn money to cure his sickly mother. He gets stronger and hides his powers. I like this anime because theres a lot of action and ruthless fighting scenes.
        </p>
    
        <p><Strong>One Piece</Strong></p>
        <p>This is one of my favorite anime because theres a lot of adventures and stories being told in all 1000+ episodes. Pirates trying to become the king of the pirates.</p>

            Relative link is within your own website/domain and its not technically required but we should use this. For example to know more about me:

        </a>
        <p>
            Aboslute link is a link to other domain like to your own cite. It always starts with "https//..../..." For example if you want to know more about the main charcter for Hajime No Ippo:
